          What is Dyno Book ?
        </h1>

        <p className="about-us-details">
          Dyno Book comes form two different words - Dynamic and Book. Yeah! You
          have guessed it right. Dyno Book means dynamic book. But why do we
          call it dynamic or what made it dynamic? And why do we call this
          website - a book? Well, let's answer the second question first. The
          answer is quite simple. We provide all the types of question here that
          you get from books. But the difference is you need to buy the books
          for those questions and we provide those for free. And we made our
          website's UI (User Interface) so simple that you will feel; you are
          reading a book not browsing a website. I hope you have got your second
          question's answer. Now, let's explain the first question! Dynamic Book
          means you can edit your book as per your preferences. For example, By
          default you don't want to see the answers of any question; you can
          hide the answers of your book. You will get unlimited random questions
          to test yourself. You can filter your question as per your preference.
          Just think about can you filter your physical book. There are lots of
          cool features like these. You need to just explore the website for a
          while.
