          What is Dyno Book ?

          Dyno Book comes form two different words - Dynamic and Book. Yeah! You have guessed it right. Dyno Book means dynamic book. But why do we call it dynamic or what made it dynamic? And why do we call this website - a book? Well, let's answer the second question first. The answer is quite simple. We provide all the types of question here that you get from books. But the difference is you need to buy the books for those questions and we provide those for free. And we made our website's UI (User Interface) so simple that you will feel; you are reading a book not browsing a website. I hope you have got your second question's answer. Now, let's explain the first question! Dynamic Book means you can edit your book as per your preferences. For example, By default you don't want to see the answers of any question; you can hide the answers of your book. You will get unlimited random questions to test yourself. You can filter your question as per your preference. Just think about can you filter your physical book. There are lots of cool features like these. You need to just explore the website for a while.
